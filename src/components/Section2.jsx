            <p>Dear Class 12 Students,</p>
            <p>
              As you prepare to step into the vast world beyond A.V.M. Convent
              School, I want to remind you of the spiritual wisdom that has
              guided humanity for centuries. Like Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita,
              focus on your dharma—your purpose—and fulfill it with dedication
              and sincerity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let the lessons of resilience, compassion, and truth be your
              guiding light. Life may present challenges, but as Lord Krishna
              said, 'Your right is to perform your duty, not to the fruits of
              your actions.' Stay committed to your values, and success will
              follow.
            </p>
            <p>
              You will always remain in our prayers and our hearts. May the
              divine blessings of peace and wisdom guide your every step.
            </p>
            <p>With endless blessings,</p>
            <p>Principal Mrs. Anita Tiagi</p>

            <p>Dear Class 12 Graduates,</p>
            <p>
              As you leave the sacred grounds of A.V.M. Convent School, remember
              the divine teachings that have shaped your journey here. Seek
              inspiration from the Vedas and Upanishads, which teach us to walk
              the path of knowledge, truth, and righteousness. In every moment
              of uncertainty, let the inner light of your atman (soul) guide you
              toward decisions that align with your dharma. Know that success is
              not measured by material gains but by how you contribute to the
              world around you.
            </p>
            <p>
              May Lord Vishnu bless you with wisdom and Lord Ganesha remove all
              obstacles from your path. My heartfelt blessings are with you as
              you embark on your journey.
            </p>
            <p>With blessings,</p>
